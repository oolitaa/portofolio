<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Olivia O.👋🏻<br>
Data Engineer & Data Analyst</h1>

## 🚀 About Me  
Greetings! My name is Olivia, I have a strong passion for **Business Intelligence** and have been working in this field for approximately 7+  years. My primary focus and expertise lie in **data engineering**, where I specialize in preparing data—gathering data from various sources, cleansing data, and building data pipelines to optimize data flow using ETL processes. I have experience in designing and managing data warehouses, optimizing database performance by adjusting indexes, queries, and partitions for efficiency, and utilizing big data technologies.

Additionally, I have extensive experience in **data analysis**, including analyzing data—processing data to extract valuable insights for businesses, creating data visualizations and dashboards, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—exploring patterns, trends, and anomalies in data, using SQL for data analysis, and providing business recommendations based on analytical findings.

This GitHub profile showcases various projects that demonstrate my technical expertise in both data engineering and data analysis, highlighting my ability to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches.
